# Effects Generator Version 2

Nowhere NEAR being done but it's coming along. Also, an excuse to practice coding outside of work, and add cool things like husky, custom lint rules, all that jazz.

## To Do

Fumble Melee - "Catch Your Breath" - on the original site, this text is too wide for the modal and needs to either be shrunken, or needs a larger modal.
Add a debug mode to generate a specific text in a modal, to validate for exactly this
Always render the modal centered depending on its height and width (Bone Masher height almost off the screen)
